07.Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit \
&emsp;&ensp;integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

11.You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and \
&emsp;&ensp;(i, height[i]).Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.Return the \
&emsp;&ensp;maximum amount of water a container can store.Notice that you may not slant the container.

15.Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and \
&emsp;&ensp;nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

49.Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

53.Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

75.Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the \
&emsp;&ensp;colors in the order red, white, and blue.We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.You must \
&emsp;&ensp;solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

151.Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

167.Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a \
&emsp;&ensp;specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.\
&emsp;&ensp;Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

287.Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.There is only one \
&emsp;&ensp;repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and using only \
&emsp;&ensp;constant extra space.

1910.Given two strings s and part, perform the following operation on s until all occurrences of the substring part are removed:Find the \
&emsp;&ensp;leftmost occurrence of the substring part and remove it from s.Return s after removing all occurrences of part.A substring is a contiguous \
&emsp;&ensp;sequence of characters in a string.
