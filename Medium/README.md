07.Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit \
&emsp;&ensp;integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

11.You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and \
&emsp;&ensp;(i, height[i]).Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.Return the \
&emsp;&ensp;maximum amount of water a container can store.Notice that you may not slant the container.

53.Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

75.Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the \
&emsp;&ensp;colors in the order red, white, and blue.We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.You must \
&emsp;&ensp;solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
