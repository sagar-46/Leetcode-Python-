07.Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit \
&emsp;&ensp;integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

11.You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and \
&emsp;&ensp;(i, height[i]).Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.Return the \
&emsp;&ensp;maximum amount of water a container can store.Notice that you may not slant the container.
