01.Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

09.Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

27.Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements \
&emsp;&emsp;may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

88.You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of \
&emsp;&emsp;elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.The final sorted \
&emsp;&emsp;array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of \
&emsp;&emsp;m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. \
&emsp;&emsp;nums2 has a length of n.

121.You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. \
&emsp;&emsp;You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. \
&emsp;&emsp;Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0. 

125.Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

136.Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.You must implement a \
&emsp;&emsp;solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

169.Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You  \
&emsp;&emsp;may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

217.Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

242.Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

268.Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

448.Given an array nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n], return an array of all the integers in the range [1, n] that do not \
&emsp;&emsp;appear in nums.

2965.You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer matrix grid of size n * n with values in the range [1, n2]. Each integer appears exactly once \
&emsp;&emsp;except a which appears twice and b which is missing. The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers a and b. Return a 0-indexed \
&emsp;&emsp;integer array ans of size 2 where ans[0] equals to a and ans[1] equals to b.
